I am Devin Chalmers. I've been working on the web since 2001, I studied math &amp; philosophy at Reed College, graduating in 2008; I've been working mostly in Cocoa ever since. I've managed to make a few pretty cool things, and I hope to write about them here. Every so often I have a thought that I feel bears writing down. Usually I'll put it in a letter to a pretty girl, but the other ones will go here.

You can see a smattering of projects at [doormouse.org](http://doormouse.org/).

In general, I think you should be as specific as possible. Specifically:
